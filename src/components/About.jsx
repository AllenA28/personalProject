            Howdy! I'm Allen Thomas, a freshman Engineering and University Honors student at Texas A&M University. I plan to graduate 
            in May 2028 with minors in Engineering Entreupreneurship and Statistics. Before coming to College Station, I lived in 
            Sugar Land, TX. I love to code, but my main interest is machine learning and its application to the real world. You can usually
            find me at any hackathon grinding out projects or at one of the rec centers on campus getting a workout in.

            My current research interests include applying artificial intelligence to the field of medicine. On that Note, I recently had the opportunity
            to join STMI lab to do just that.
